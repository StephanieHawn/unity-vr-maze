# Windows 95 VR Maze
A mobile VR game built for Google Cardboard for those that need to fulfill their nostalgia of the old Windows 95 operating systems. This virtual reality project sees the player navigate the Windows 95 screensaver environment, requiring them to collect keys that enable their escape.
